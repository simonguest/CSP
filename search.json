    "text": "WebSockets is a communication protocol that enables full-duplex, bidirectional interaction between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, which follows a request-response model, WebSockets establish a persistent channel that allows both parties to send and receive data in real time without repeatedly opening new connections. This makes it highly efficient for scenarios where low latency and continuous updates are critical, such as chat applications, live notifications, multiplayer games, and real-time data streaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Client[\"Client (e.g., Browser, Mobile App)\"]\n        C1[WebSocket Client Library]\n        C2[Application Logic]\n        C2 --&gt; C1\n    end\n\n    subgraph Server[\"Server\"]\n        S1[WebSocket Server Endpoint]\n        S2[Application Logic / Handlers]\n        S3[Database / External APIs]\n        S2 --&gt; S3\n        S1 --&gt; S2\n    end\n\n    C1 &lt;--&gt; |Persistent WebSocket Connection| S1\n\n    %% Styling for readability\n    style Client fill:#f0f9ff,stroke:#0369a1,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n    style Server fill:#fef9c3,stroke:#ca8a04,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most popular WebSockets library for Python is websockets, a lightweight, easy-to-use, and widely adopted library that provides both client and server implementations conforming to the WebSocket protocol.
