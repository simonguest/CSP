    "text": "WebSockets is a communication protocol that enables full-duplex, bidirectional interaction between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, which follows a request-response model, WebSockets establish a persistent channel that allows both parties to send and receive data in real time without repeatedly opening new connections. This makes it highly efficient for scenarios where low latency and continuous updates are critical, such as chat applications, live notifications, multiplayer games, and real-time data streaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Client[\"Client (e.g., Browser, Mobile App)\"]\n        C1[WebSocket Client Library]\n        C2[Application Logic]\n        C2 --&gt; C1\n    end\n\n    subgraph Server[\"Server\"]\n        S1[WebSocket Server Endpoint]\n        S2[Application Logic / Handlers]\n        S3[Database / External APIs]\n        S2 --&gt; S3\n        S1 --&gt; S2\n    end\n\n    C1 &lt;--&gt; |Persistent WebSocket Connection| S1\n\n    %% Styling for readability\n    style Client fill:#f0f9ff,stroke:#0369a1,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n    style Server fill:#fef9c3,stroke:#ca8a04,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most popular WebSockets library for Python is websockets, a lightweight, easy-to-use, and widely adopted library that provides both client and server implementations conforming to the WebSocket protocol.

    "text": "HTTP/3 is the latest major revision of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, designed to make web communication faster, more reliable, and better suited for modern network conditions. Unlike HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, which are built on top of TCP, HTTP/3 runs over QUIC, a transport protocol based on UDP. By leveraging QUIC, HTTP/3 benefits from features such as built-in encryption (TLS 1.3), multiplexed streams without head-of-line blocking, reduced connection setup time, and graceful handling of network changes (e.g., switching from WiFi to cellular).\nHTTP/3 is increasingly used by browsers, CDNs, and backend services to improve page load times, streaming performance, and resilience to packet loss in high-latency networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Client[\"Client (e.g., Browser, Mobile App)\"]\n        C1[HTTP/3 Stack]\n        C2[Application Logic]\n        C2 --&gt; C1\n    end\n\n    subgraph Server[\"Server\"]\n        S1[HTTP/3-capable Web Server / CDN]\n        S2[Application Logic / Handlers]\n        S3[Database / External APIs]\n        S2 --&gt; S3\n        S1 --&gt; S2\n    end\n\n    C1 &lt;--&gt; |\"QUIC (UDP-based) Transport\"| S1\n\n    %% Styling\n    style Client fill:#f0f9ff,stroke:#0369a1,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n    style Server fill:#fef9c3,stroke:#ca8a04,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most widely used Python library for HTTP/3 and QUIC is aioquic.\n\nIt’s an implementation of QUIC and HTTP/3 built on top of asyncio.\nSupports client and server roles, TLS 1.3, and custom protocol experimentation.\nUseful for both low-level QUIC experiments and HTTP/3 integration with web servers.\n\nOther frameworks are beginning to add HTTP/3 support (e.g., Hypercorn or uvicorn with custom workers), but aioquic remains the go-to library today.\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem Maturity – HTTP/3 adoption is growing, but not all clients, servers, proxies, or CDNs support it yet.\nUDP Dependency – Some networks (corporate firewalls, older routers) may block or throttle UDP traffic, limiting HTTP/3’s performance benefits.\nResource Usage – Running on top of UDP requires more aggressive congestion control and buffer handling, which may make server-side scaling more complex.\nDebugging & Monitoring – Tools for packet inspection and debugging are less mature than for TCP/HTTP/2.\nFallback Complexity – Many servers and browsers negotiate between HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3, which adds operational complexity.\nNot Always Faster – For very stable, low-latency connections, HTTP/2 may perform competitively; HTTP/3 shines in lossy or high-latency links.",

    "text": "WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a set of APIs and protocols that enables direct peer-to-peer communication between clients (such as web browsers or mobile apps) without routing all traffic through a central server. It supports real-time transfer of audio, video, and arbitrary data, making it ideal for video conferencing, voice calls, live streaming, and real-time file sharing. Unlike WebSockets, which always rely on a continuous connection with a server, WebRTC establishes a direct connection between peers, often requiring signaling servers and STUN/TURN servers to help with connection setup and NAT/firewall traversal.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph ClientA[\"Client A (e.g., Browser, Mobile App)\"]\n        A1[WebRTC API]\n        A2[App Logic]\n        A2 --&gt; A1\n    end\n\n    subgraph ClientB[\"Client B (e.g., Browser, Mobile App)\"]\n        B1[WebRTC API]\n        B2[App Logic]\n        B2 --&gt; B1\n    end\n\n    subgraph Signaling[\"Signaling Server\"]\n        S1[Exchange Session Descriptions & ICE Candidates]\n    end\n\n    subgraph STUN_TURN[\"STUN / TURN Servers\"]\n        N1[Helps with NAT Traversal / Relay Media if Needed]\n    end\n\n    %% Corrected edges (no parentheses or slashes in text)\n    A1 &lt;--&gt; |\"Signaling over WebSocket or HTTP\"| S1\n    B1 &lt;--&gt; |\"Signaling over WebSocket or HTTP\"| S1\n    A1 &lt;--&gt; |\"Peer-to-Peer Media & Data\"| B1\n    A1 &lt;--&gt; N1\n    B1 &lt;--&gt; N1\n\n    %% Styling\n    style ClientA fill:#f0f9ff,stroke:#0369a1,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n    style ClientB fill:#ede9fe,stroke:#6d28d9,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n    style Signaling fill:#fef9c3,stroke:#ca8a04,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n    style STUN_TURN fill:#dcfce7,stroke:#15803d,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px",

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\n\nSignaling Dependency – WebRTC itself does not specify how peers discover and exchange connection information; a separate signaling mechanism (e.g., WebSockets or HTTP) is always required.\nNAT and Firewall Traversal – Direct peer-to-peer connections can fail in restrictive network environments, making STUN/TURN servers necessary, which adds complexity and cost.\nScalability – Peer-to-peer topologies work well for small groups, but scaling to large calls (e.g., many participants in a video conference) typically requires media servers (SFU/MCU).\nImplementation Complexity – WebRTC supports multiple codecs, transport mechanisms, and NAT traversal strategies, which can be complex to configure correctly.\nResource Intensive – Real-time audio and video encoding/decoding can be CPU and bandwidth heavy, especially on lower-powered devices.\nLimited Server Control – Since traffic often flows directly between peers, servers have less visibility and control compared to client-server communication models like WebSockets.",
