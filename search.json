    "text": "WebSockets is a communication protocol that enables full-duplex, bidirectional interaction between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, which follows a request-response model, WebSockets establish a persistent channel that allows both parties to send and receive data in real time without repeatedly opening new connections. This makes it highly efficient for scenarios where low latency and continuous updates are critical, such as chat applications, live notifications, multiplayer games, and real-time data streaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Client[\"Client (e.g., Browser, Mobile App)\"]\n        C1[WebSocket Client Library]\n        C2[Application Logic]\n        C2 --&gt; C1\n    end\n\n    subgraph Server[\"Server\"]\n        S1[WebSocket Server Endpoint]\n        S2[Application Logic / Handlers]\n        S3[Database / External APIs]\n        S2 --&gt; S3\n        S1 --&gt; S2\n    end\n\n    C1 &lt;--&gt; |Persistent WebSocket Connection| S1\n\n    %% Styling for readability\n    style Client fill:#f0f9ff,stroke:#0369a1,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n    style Server fill:#fef9c3,stroke:#ca8a04,stroke-width:2px,rounded-corners:5px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most popular WebSockets library for Python is websockets, a lightweight, easy-to-use, and widely adopted library that provides both client and server implementations conforming to the WebSocket protocol.

    "text": "Limitations\n\nSignaling Dependency – WebRTC itself does not specify how peers discover and exchange connection information; a separate signaling mechanism (e.g., WebSockets or HTTP) is always required.\nNAT and Firewall Traversal – Direct peer-to-peer connections can fail in restrictive network environments, making STUN/TURN servers necessary, which adds complexity and cost.\nScalability – Peer-to-peer topologies work well for small groups, but scaling to large calls (e.g., many participants in a video conference) typically requires media servers (SFU/MCU).\nImplementation Complexity – WebRTC supports multiple codecs, transport mechanisms, and NAT traversal strategies, which can be complex to configure correctly.\nResource Intensive – Real-time audio and video encoding/decoding can be CPU and bandwidth heavy, especially on lower-powered devices.\nLimited Server Control – Since traffic often flows directly between peers, servers have less visibility and control compared to client-server communication models like WebSockets.",
