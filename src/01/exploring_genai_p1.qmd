# A Brief History of Transformer Models

## A Brief History of Transformer Models

```{mermaid}
timeline
    June 2017 : Google researchers publish "Attention is all you need" paper [1]
              : Introduces self-attention mechanism and transformer architecture
              : Eliminates the need for recurrent neural networks in sequence processing

    June 2018 : OpenAI releases GPT-1
              : 117M parameters
              : Demonstrates pre-training on large text corpora followed by fine-tuning works effectively

    Feb 2019 : OpenAI releases GPT-2
             : 1.5B parameters
             : Initially withheld full model due to concerns about misuse
             : Demonstrates impressive text generation capabilities with minimal fine-tuning

    May 2020 : OpenAI releases GPT-3
             : 175B parameters
             : Demonstrates strong few-shot learning capabilities
             : Marks a significant leap in model capabilities and scale

    June 2020 : GPT-3 available through OpenAI API
              : Still a completion model, not instruction-tuned
```

## Completion vs. Instruction-Tuned

- Completion Model just predicts the next token
  - Input prompt: `Mary had a little`
  - Max total tokens: `50`
  - Temperature: `0 - 1.0`
  - top_k: consider only the top k tokens in the response
  - top_p: Nucleus sampling (probability cut off - 0 and 1.0)
- Output
  - `Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow...`  (up to max tokens)

## Completion vs. Instruction-Tuned

- You can't really converse with it
- `What is the capital of France?` (max tokens = 50)
- `What is the capital of France? Paris. What is the capital of Spain? Madrid. What is the capital of`
- But it's the foundation of today's text models, and fun to play with...

## Introducing Google Colab

[GPT-2.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H0NZYU-U3BmTS2bUqrVw9ssuFsp5mr8n?usp=sharing){.external target="_blank"}

## Instruction-Tuned Models

- Supervised Fine-Tuning
  - Large datasets of questions/answers, tasks/completions, demonstrating helpful assistant behavior
- RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
  - Human raters rank different model responses, training a reward model
- Chat Templates
  - Structured formats to distinguish speakers in a dialog: Typically system, user, and assistant

## A Brief History of Transformer Models

```{mermaid}
timeline
    2021 : InstructGPT Development
          : Built on GPT-3 with RLHF fine-tuning
          : Trained to follow instructions and understand user intent
          : Key innovation enabling ChatGPT
    
    Jan 2021 : Anthropic Founded
             : Founded by Dario & Daniela Amodei with ~7 senior OpenAI employees
            : Dario led GPT-2/3 development and co-invented RLHF

    Nov 2022 : ChatGPT Launch
                  : Built on GPT-3.5 using RLHF
                  : 1M+ users in 5 days
                  : Sparked widespread interest in generative AI

    Feb 2023 : Llama 1 Released
                  : Meta's LLaMA (7B, 13B, 33B, 65B parameters)
                  : 13B model exceeded GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks
                  : Limited researcher access
                  : Text completion only (Alpaca fine-tune added instructions)

    Jul 2023 : Llama 2 Released
              : Available in 7B, 13B, 70B sizes
              : Trained on 40% more data than Llama 1
              : First open-weights Llama for commercial use
```

## Closed vs. Open Models

- **Closed Source:** Hosted models; no ability to inspect the weights of the models. Accessed via an API (or UI).
  - Examples: OpenAI GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Open Weight:** Model files with pretrained weights, but no training data. Host on your own hardware.
  - Examples: Meta's Llama (and derivatives), Gemma 
- **Open Source:** Models with access to the training data set. Create from scratch.
  - Examples: OLMo from AI2

# Calling Models via APIs

## Calling Models via APIs

- HTTP-based APIs
  - Client makes HTTP API calls to invoke/access the model
  - (Normally use an SDK to wrap the HTTP API calls)
  - Client passes Authorization token as part of the call
  - Default way of accessing OpenAI, Claude, other large, closed-source models

## Demo: OpenAI SDK/API call {.center}

[OpenAI.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ktzdxJUcHQ6yEY8tJSeikTXjVgwG9DLc?usp=sharing){.external target="_blank"}

## OpenAI's Chat Completions API

- Debuted in March 2023, together with the ChatGPT API
- Structure
  - Messages array (system, assistant, user)
  - Streaming support (using SSE - Server Side Events)
  - Function calling (added mid-2023)
  - Structured output (added Aug 2024)
- Widespread Adoption
  - Anthropic, Azure, TogetherAI
  - Local hosting: vLLM, LM Studio

## OpenAI's Chat Completions API

How do we consume different models from multiple providers?

- Introducing OpenRouter (https://openrouter.ai)
  - A unified API to hundreds of AI models through a single endpoint
  - (Using OpenAI's Chat Completion API)
  - OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Nova, Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen, and many others.
  - Pay per API call, often same cost as the provider

# Downloading and Running Models

## Downloading and Running Models

- So far, we've called hosted models via APIs
- How about downloading and running models on your own hardware?
  - (Obviously they need to be open-weight models)

## Downloading and Running Models

Why would you want to do this?

- Offline access to models (no Internet required)
- Potential cost savings (if many API calls and already own hardware)
  - e.g., running a small model embedded within a game
- Want to fine-tune your own model and have the hardware to do it
- Don't want others to see the conversations you are having :)

## Introducing Hugging Face

![Source: https://huggingface.co](./images/huggingface.png)

## What is Hugging Face?

It is to AI models what GitHub is to source code

- Explore, download models to run on local hardware
- Upload and share your own trained/fine-tuned models and datasets
- Create "Spaces" - web-based apps for accessing models

## Demo: Exploring a Model {.center}

[Google's gemma-3-1b-it on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-1b-it){.external target="_blank"}

## Hugging Face Transformers

![Source: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers](./images/transformers.png)

## Hugging Face Transformers

What is the Hugging Face Transformers Library?

- Open-source Python library to provide easy access to using various types of pre-trained transformer models
- Brings together all of the different formats under one interface
   - Different models, vendors, types, chat templates
   - Different implementations: PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX
- A few lines of code to download and run the model

## Demo: Using HF Transformers to download and use Gemma 3 1B {.center}

## "Out of VRAM"

One challenge of running models on your own hardware is VRAM

- Roughly speaking, the size of the model will determine how much VRAM you need
- Gemma 3 models
  - gemma-3-1b-it = 2Gb
  - gemma-3-4b-it = 8.6Gb
  - gemma-3-12b-it = 23.37Gb
  - Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking = ~475Gb

## "Out of VRAM"

- Google Colab Tiers
  - Colab Free T4 = 16Gb VRAM (15Gb usable)
  - Colab Pro V100 = 16Gb VRAM
  - Colab Pro A100 = 40Gb VRAM 
- Your Gaming PC
  - Probably 8Gb VRAM
- Your Phone
  - V-what? :)


## "Out of VRAM"

You can select smaller models, but they are less accurate / more prone to hallucination.

- How do we fix this?
  - Quantization

## Quantization

Process of reducing the precision of a model's weights and activations. For example, 16-bit numbers to 4-bit.

- Parameter count matters more than precision
  - A 70B parameter model at 4-bit often beats a 13B model at b16
  - The models knowledge remains largely intact
  - Often the extra precision doesn't meaningfully improve outputs

## Quantization Formats

The llama.cpp project (implementing LLMs in pure C/C++) has driven advancements in quantization

- GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format)
  - Single file architecture
  - Model format supporting multiple quantization levels (2-bit through 8-bit) with CPU and GPU handoff
- MLX (Apple's ML framework and format for Apple Silicon)
  - Debuted in late 2023
  - Supports 4 and 8 bit quantization schemes

## Running Quantized Models

- Tools built upon llama.cpp
  - Ollama, LM Studio, koboldcpp

## Demo: Running Gemma 3 27B GGUF on my laptop {.center}
